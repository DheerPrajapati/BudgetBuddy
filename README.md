# BudgetBuddy
Repo for a budgeting app called Budget Buddy!

The project that our group, CE Enjoyers, worked on this semester is called Budget Buddy! Budget Buddy is a budgeting/finance app that helps make budgeting easier. This app is targeted towards college students or newer budgeters but can be used by anyone. The main problem we tried to tackle is that most budgeting apps out there are complex, require some amount of budgeting/financial knowledge already, or aren't super user-friendly. Our solution was a simple, easy-to-use, yet powerful app that makes budgeting easy and effective for users at varying levels of wealth and knowledge
